        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Web applications consist of two main types of scripting: Client-Side Scripting and Server-Side Scripting. Both types of scripting play crucial roles in making web applications interactive, dynamic, and functional. In this article, we’ll explore the differences, use cases, advantages, and disadvantages of client-side and server-side scripting, complete with code examples and illustrations.

        <h2>What is Client-Side Scripting?</h2>
        <p>
            Client-side scripting refers to code that is executed on the user's browser, primarily used to create a dynamic, interactive experience on the front end of a website. This type of scripting is often handled by languages like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Client-side scripts are ideal for tasks that require quick responses and interactivity without sending data back to the server.
        </p>

        <h3>Characteristics of Client-Side Scripting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Executed on the client’s web browser.</li>
            <li>Reduces server load by processing tasks locally.</li>
            <li>Used for user interface updates, form validations, and animations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Code Example: Basic JavaScript Alert</h3>
        <p>Below is an example of a simple client-side script using JavaScript to display an alert box.</p>
        <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Client-Side Scripting Example&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;button onclick="displayAlert()"&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;
        
        &lt;script&gt;
            function displayAlert() {
                alert("Hello, this is a client-side script!");
            }
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </pre>

        <h2>What is Server-Side Scripting?</h2>
        <p>
            Server-side scripting involves scripts that run on a web server to generate dynamic content before it’s sent to the user’s browser. This type of scripting is often written in languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js. Server-side scripting is essential for tasks that involve accessing databases, handling authentication, and securely processing user data.
        </p>

        <h3>Characteristics of Server-Side Scripting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Executed on the server, not visible to the client.</li>
            <li>Handles tasks like database access, form processing, and authentication.</li>
            <li>Provides security by managing sensitive information server-side.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Code Example: PHP Script to Display Date</h3>
        <p>Below is an example of a basic server-side script written in PHP to display the current date on a web page.</p>
        <pre>
&lt;?php
    // Server-side script in PHP
    echo "Today's date is: " . date("Y-m-d");
?&gt;
        </pre>

        <h2>Combining Client-Side and Server-Side Scripting</h2>
        <p>
            In modern web applications, client-side and server-side scripting often work together to deliver a seamless, dynamic experience. The client-side script handles immediate interactions and UI changes, while server-side scripts manage data-intensive tasks and security. AJAX is a popular technique for integrating client-side JavaScript with server-side processing, enabling dynamic content updates without reloading the page.
