        <h2>Introduction to Web Servers</h2>
        <p>
            A web server is software and hardware that accepts requests via the HTTP or HTTPS protocols and provides responses, typically in the form of web pages. It serves as the backbone of websites, enabling the transfer of data from server to client (usually a web browser). This note explores the concepts of local and remote servers, the configuration of a PHP environment with WAMP, and the differences between static and dynamic website development.

        <h2>Basics of Web Servers</h2>
        <p>
            Web servers play a crucial role in hosting websites and applications. They handle HTTP requests and provide resources such as HTML files, CSS, JavaScript, and images back to the client. Web servers can be software-based, like Apache and Nginx, or hardware that hosts these applications.
        </p>
        <p>Key terms to understand:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong> The protocol used by web servers to deliver content over the web.</li>
            <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> The process of storing web applications and content on a web server to be accessible over the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Domain Name System (DNS):</strong> Translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load resources.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="local-vs-remote-servers">
        <h2>Local Servers vs. Remote Servers</h2>
        <p>
            Web development often requires the use of both local and remote servers. Each serves a distinct purpose:
        </p>

        <h3>Local Servers</h3>
        <p>
            A <strong>local server</strong> is a web server environment hosted on your local machine. This setup is primarily used for development and testing before deploying a site or application publicly. Popular local server software includes WAMP, XAMPP, and MAMP.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <strong>Benefits of Local Servers:</strong>
            - Easy and fast testing environment for web developers.
            - No need for an internet connection to access the site.
            - Allows testing of different configurations without affecting live content.
        </pre>

        <h3>Remote Servers</h3>
        <p>
            A <strong>remote server</strong> is a server hosted on the internet or a dedicated data center. This type of server hosts the live version of your site, allowing public access. Remote servers require web hosting providers like AWS, DigitalOcean, or shared hosting providers.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <strong>Benefits of Remote Servers:</strong>
            - Accessible globally to all users.
            - Suitable for production environments with managed security and backups.
            - Scalable to handle traffic depending on the server configuration.

        <h2>Installing WAMP and Configuring PHP Environment</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>WAMP</strong> (Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) is a local server stack designed for Windows users. It allows you to host a PHP/MySQL environment locally on your PC. Below are steps to install and configure WAMP:
        </p>

        <h3>Steps to Install WAMP</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the WAMP software from <a href="https://www.wampserver.com/">the official WAMP website</a>.</li>
            <li>Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.</li>
            <li>Choose a directory where WAMP will be installed, and select default settings unless customization is needed.</li>
            <li>Once installed, open WAMP and ensure the services (Apache, MySQL) are running.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Configuring PHP Environment</h3>
        <p>
            To configure PHP in WAMP, follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the WAMP control panel and select the "PHP" option.</li>
            <li>Select "php.ini" to edit PHP settings. Here, you can configure various settings such as upload_max_filesize, post_max_size, and display_errors.</li>
            <li>Restart WAMP to apply any changes made in the php.ini file.</li>
        </ol>

        <pre>
&lt;?php
    // Test PHP configuration in WAMP
    phpinfo(); // Outputs PHP configuration info
?&gt;
        </pre>

    <section id="static-vs-dynamic-websites">
        <h2>Static vs. Dynamic Website Development</h2>
        <p>
            Websites can be classified as either static or dynamic. Let’s look at the differences:
        </p>

        <h3>Static Websites</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Static websites</strong> consist of fixed content that doesn’t change unless modified by a developer. They are built with HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript for minor interactivity.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <strong>Pros of Static Websites:</strong>
            - Faster loading times as the content is simple and fixed.
            - Easier to develop and maintain.
            - Lower cost and better security due to fewer moving parts.

            <strong>Cons:</strong>
            - Limited interactivity and personalization for users.
            - Requires developer intervention for content updates.
        </pre>

        <h3>Dynamic Websites</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Dynamic websites</strong> are built with server-side scripting languages like PHP and can display dynamic content based on user interactions. These websites often include databases for storing and retrieving content.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <strong>Pros of Dynamic Websites:</strong>
            - Content updates and personalization without developer involvement.
            - Enables user interaction, logins, and form submissions.
            - Scalable for handling more complex applications.

            <strong>Cons:</strong>
            - Slower performance compared to static sites due to database queries.
            - Higher maintenance costs and security concerns.
